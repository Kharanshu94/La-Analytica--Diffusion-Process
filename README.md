# La-Analytica--Diffusion-Process(Solar Cell)

Diffusion - It is one of the process in solar cell manufacturing which is mainly responsible for creating P-N junction.

Rsheet -  Known as sheet resistance act as matric to verify health of the diffusion process.

It is necessary to maintain Rsheet in certain specified range hence monitoring its metric(Rsheet) is essential  

Excel VBA Based Solution named La Analytica to contineously monitor Inline Rsheet Data generated in Diffusion machine of Solar cell manufacturing process 

Two Individual solutions were develop which works in tandom to analyse real-time data from single PC connected in common network

La Analytica -  An VBA based excel is installed in PC located in remote place where a person can Analyse Zone-wise  Rsheet data

La Stimulus -  This is installed in machine which continuously transfer data to La Analytica software.
